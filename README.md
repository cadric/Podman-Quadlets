# Quadlet Container Files for Podman (Rootless Setup)

This repository contains `.container` files for use with Podman and Quadlets in a rootless environment.

## Installation Instructions

### Step 1: Place the Files

Move the container files to the following directory:

```bash
/home/YOURUSERNAME/.config/containers/systemd
```

> **Important:** Replace `YOURUSERNAME` with your actual username on the system.

If the directories don't exist, create them by navigating to `/home/YOURUSERNAME/.config/` and running the following commands:

```bash
mkdir -p containers/systemd
```

Make sure to also update any paths inside the `.container` files to match your username.

### Step 2: Create Local Folders for Volumes

Before starting the Quadlet services, you need to create the local directories that the `Volume=` entries point to. For example, if you have the following in your `.container` files:

```bash
Volume=/home/YOURUSERNAME/jellyfin/config:/config:Z
Volume=/home/YOURUSERNAME/jellyfin/cache:/cache:Z
Volume=/home/YOURUSERNAME/jellyfin/media:/media:Z
```

You will need to create these directories on your system. Run the following commands:

```bash
mkdir -p /home/YOURUSERNAME/jellyfin/config
mkdir -p /home/YOURUSERNAME/jellyfin/cache
mkdir -p /home/YOURUSERNAME/jellyfin/media
```

> **Reminder:** Replace `YOURUSERNAME` with your actual username.

### Step 3: Reload Systemd Daemon

To allow `systemd` to find your user files, run the following command:

```bash
systemctl --user daemon-reload
```

### Step 4: Start Your Quadlet Services

Use the following commands to start the specific Quadlet services you need. Replace `jellyfin` and `jellyseerr` with the appropriate service names for your containers:

```bash
systemctl --user start jellyfin
systemctl --user start jellyseerr
```

### Step 5: Enable Auto-Restart After Reboot

To ensure that your Quadlet services restart automatically after a reboot, run the following command:

```bash
loginctl enable-linger
```

### Step 6: Open Firewall Ports (If Applicable)

If you have a firewall running on your server (Fedora 40 has `firewalld` running by default), make sure to open the necessary ports for the services you are running.

### I highly recommend that you use cockpit for this, which is allready is running on port 9090 if you are using fedora server.

```bash
# Open ports for Sonarr, Jellyfin, and Jellyseerr
firewall-cmd --add-port=8989/tcp --permanent  # Sonarr
firewall-cmd --add-port=8096/tcp --permanent  # Jellyfin
firewall-cmd --add-port=5055/tcp --permanent  # Jellyseerr
firewall-cmd --add-port=13378/tcp --permanent # Audiobookshelf

# Reload the firewall for the changes to take effect
firewall-cmd --reload
```

> **Note:** Replace the port numbers with those used by your services if they differ from the examples above.

## To Update Your Quadlets use...

To update your quadlets, you can run:

```bash
podman auto-update
```

This will check all quadlets for updates and apply them if needed.

If you are using Fedora Server, it comes with an automatic timer that runs at midnight. You can enable it with:

```bash
systemctl --user enable --now podman-auto-update.timer
```

2. **Check the status of the timer**:
   You can check if the timer is active and running correctly by running:

   ```bash
   systemctl --user status podman-auto-update.timer
   ```

   You should see something like this, where the next trigger will be at midnight (or the time you have set):

   ```bash
   ‚óè podman-auto-update.timer - Podman auto-update timer
        Loaded: loaded (/usr/lib/systemd/system/podman-auto-update.timer; enabled; preset: disabled)
        Active: active (waiting) since Tue 2024-10-22 14:30:02 CEST; 2h 14min ago
       Trigger: Wed 2024-10-23 00:00:00 CEST; 6h left
   ```

## Additional Notes

- Ensure that you update all instances of `YOURUSERNAME` in the commands and `.container` files to match your actual username.
- Make sure to create all the necessary local directories for any `Volume=` entries before starting the Quadlet services.
- Open the required ports on your firewall if it's running.
- This setup has been tested on **Fedora 40**.
